## Introduction 

With the increasing popularity of searching music on the internet, and my own love of going to concerts, I came up with the idea of SoundStub. With SoundStub you can search for your favorite artist simultaneously finding that artists upcoming concerts and a link to be able to to buy tickets for that show.
